#  Mental Health Treatment Prediction  

##  **Overview**  
This project focuses on predicting whether an individual is likely to seek mental health treatment based on survey responses. By applying machine learning models, exploratory analysis, and statistical tests, the goal is to identify key factors influencing mental health treatment decisions.

## ✨ **Features**  
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Visualized distributions, correlations, and relationships across variables.  

- **📈 Statistical Analysis (Chi-Square Test):**  
  Identified significant associations between categorical features and treatment outcomes.  

- **Sentiment Analysis:**  
  Extracted and analyzed emotional tones from textual responses.  

- **Data Encoding:**  
  Applied **Label Encoding** and **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical variables.  

- **Machine Learning Models:**  
  Implemented and compared multiple models for prediction:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - Gradient Boosting  
  - MLP Neural Network  

- **Feature Importance (Random Forest):**  
  Determined which features most influenced mental health treatment predictions.  


- **Deployment (Streamlit App):**  
  Built an interactive web app where users can input details and get predictions in real time.
